;;;							TACTICS
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The tactical choices will affect the troops in various ways, ranging from
	increasing their attack power or defense to causing damage to the 
	potential loot that is currently being fought for.
the ability to use more advanced tactics will come from fighting more
	battles, and perhaps even some new items.
Choosing a tactic that is appropriate for the troops you are using is
	critical for success.

;;;							COMMANDER
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The commander represents the player and a golden opportunity to take the
	game down to the personal level.
The extent to which the commander is used will vary from player to player.
I feel it will be important to provide many options for customization and
	enhancement to really provide an extra element to the gameplay.
	
Just like the troops, the commander will have the 3 basic stats:
	Strength
	Defense
	Health
However, unlike the troops, these stats will begin at a base value and can
	be increased with personal equipment like firearms, armor etc.
This will require many new items that will have limited use and a unique
	method for bringing them into the game may be preferable to the 
	standard looting.  Perhaps awarding them after battle would be better?
These stats will also increase according to level (see below)
	
The commander will also possess the Advanced abilities and these will be 
	included in the battle calculations whether the commander is in
	direct combat or not.
These abilities will increase by level (see below)

The commander will also posses the SKILL attribute a Combat Level and Combat XP.
	A successful battle will award 10XP, a failed battle will award 2XP
	and the levels will be determined as follows:
	

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;							ENEMIES
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is not in our best interest to create enemy troop items to fight against
	but rather to simply simulate enemy troops.  The enemy will not use
	any tactics, but it would be assumed that when a tactic fails (due to 
	chance or lack of troop ability, commander skill etc.) the enemy was
	responsible.
It may be worthwhile to build a list of sovereigns and each sov have a list
	of target numbers that would be used in the success/failure calculations
	when the player chooses a tactic.
This could provide differentiation between the Sovs/factions, so that the 
	Luminous will be immune to a psionic attack but will be vulnerable to
	hackers.
This data could be stored on a single virtual item in the following format:
	(itmGetStaticData &bp_FactionData; "Luminous") will return:
		(list
			;; base stats
			3	; Strength
			2	; Defense
			1	; Health
			;; adv. ability modifiers (%)
			100	; C3I
			150	; Stealth
			0	; Psionics are useless
			150	; Hacker
			200	; Healer
			100	; Demolitions
			100	; Commando
			;; number of enemy troops
			1d3+2	; number of troops appearing
			)
	where a value of 100 means that the player's ability is unmodified,
	and a value >100 is more effective, <100 is less effective and 0
	is an immunity.
The base stats (ST, DF, and HP) are based on per/troop item values
	and would be summed after calculating the number of troops present 
	from the dice range value.
